## Description
I find it surprisingly difficult to keep the events of my life in coherent order. It isn't even that my life has been so eventful, it's just that time is confusing. A decade ago I wrote a program to help me keep track of it all. The site still works, but it's pretty rough around the edges so I am re-writing it from the ground up using Mongoose / React / Node.

After making an account, you can store all of the events in your life in the database and associate them with tags. So I have a tag for the places I've lived "geography" and one for the important things that have happened to me "milestones". You can then view all of the events for a particular tag (or combination of tags) as a timeline of events.

## Next Steps
This is still far in the pre-release stages, where I'm just adding functionality. I'm still making aestethic choices, and after that's all done there's a lot of optimization to do.

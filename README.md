## Description
I find it surprisingly difficult to keep the events of my life in coherent order. It isn't even that my life has been so eventful, it's just that time is confusing. A decade ago I wrote a program to help me keep track of it all. The site still works, but it's pretty rough around the edges so I am re-writing it from the ground up using Mongoose / React / Node.

After making an account, you can store all of the events in your life in the database and associate them with tags. You could make a tag for the places you've lived called "geography," maybe, or one for the important things that have happened to you called "milestones". You can then view all of the events for a particular tag (or combination of tags) as a timeline of events. 

The app also uses styled-components so that it has a "dark mode" and a "light mode" setting, which I'm quite pleased with.
